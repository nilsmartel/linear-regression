# Linear Regression

Automatic inference of linear parameters given data samples.

Example output:

    average loss: 2934374.3317180616
    average loss: 280041.6596403049
    average loss: 279.98043616266415
    average loss: 24.083934224368623
    average loss: 3.331345230290604
    average loss: 3.010156294317643
    average loss: 3.003166222164049
    average loss: 2.850446167321281
    average loss: 2.55121275143886
    average loss: 2.81526766333031

    alpha: 3.1412931539837015
    beta: 0.9949864174361753


here we can see, that the loss of the linear regressor (actually, what _is_ the proper term for this?) dramatically decreases.
The `loss` here is a measure of how _"badly"_ the linear parameters are able to help predict the actually data points given as input.
